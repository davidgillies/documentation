Creating a design
=================

You need first to create an extension (please refer to
:ref:`creating-an-extension`). After you need to:

- enable Grok in your extension (:ref:`enable-grok-for-your-extension`),

- include ``silva.core.contentlayout`` as a dependency in the
  ``configure.zcml`` of your extension.
