Configuring Apache to present your site to the world
====================================================

By default Zope has its own web server, which can host multiple Silva
sites. However it is difficult to configure to which URLs (like
http://mysite.com) Zope is going to reply, and with which Silva site.

To solve this, people uses Apache in proxy mode, to *route* requests
to the correct Silva site within Zope: for instance
http://www.mysite.com to the Silva site http://localhost:8080/mysite
which have been created in Zope. We are going to *rewrite URLs* them
because we want Zope to generate URLs starting with
http://www.mysite.com/ instead of http://localhost:8080/mysite.

You are free to use other proxy software if they support rewriting of
URLs. You can use `Nginx`_ or directly `Squid`_ if you want to do
caching as well.

Configuring rewrite rules in Apache
-----------------------------------

First you need enable the following modules in Apache:

- ``mod_rewrite``.

- ``mod_proxy`` (actually ``mod_proxy_http``). You don't need to
  authorize any proxy operation.

After you can edit your Apache configuration to define a virtual host
for your site. With ``mod_rewrite`` you will be able to effectively
define the redirection from your site (http://mysite.com) to your Zope
server and your Silva site within (http://localhost:8080/mysite):

.. code-block:: apache
   :linenos:

   <VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName www.mysite.com
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:8080/VirtualHostBase/http/%{SERVER_NAME}:80/mysite/VirtualHostRoot/$1 [L,P]
   </VirtualHost>

Explanation:

- On line 2, we declare the site we are handling.

- On line 3, we activate ``mod_rewrite`` for this site.

- On line 4, we redirect all requests to Zope rewriting them for the
  Zope virtual host rewrite engine. At the end of the line, the ``P``
  flag tells ``mod_rewrite`` to proxy the request to the rewritten URL
  and return the result.

Zope Virtual Host Rewrite Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In our case, Zope listens on localhost, port 8080. Apache relocates
the received request to our Zope server on
``http://localhost:8080/``. After this the URL is rewritten in the
form of::

  VirtualHostBase/protocol/site-name/path/to/silva/site/VirtualHostRoot/rest

``VirtualHostBase`` tells you that we are going to want to rewrite
generated URLs by Zope. ``protocol`` defines which protocol the site
is using (``http`` or ``https``). ``site-name`` is the name of your
site (``www.mysite.com`` in our case). In the example we use the
Apache variable ``%{SERVER_NAME}`` which is replaced by Apache to the
site name mentioned in request (that should be the same than
``ServerName``, but can be as well one of ``ServerAlias`` if you
configured them and the visitor used it). After this,
``path/to/silva/site`` represent the path in Zope to the Silva Root
your created (``mysite`` in our case). ``VirtualHostRoot`` mark the
end of this previously mentioned path, and so after Apache add the URL
the visitor entered as ``rest`` (like for instance
``/myfolder/in/silva``, if the visitor visited
http://www.mysite.com/myfolder/in/silva).

For more information on Apache configuration see `the official website
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs>`_.

If you want more details about the rewriting of URLs in apache, you
can have a look to `the official user guide for mod_rewrite
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/>`_


Using rewrite rules to manipulate Silva URLs
--------------------------------------------

Some people have the use case to have different URLs structure inside
Silva and for the public.  This presents a problem because the URL
rewriting system is not able to compute URLs that are not inside the
virtual rewriting root.

Here is an example:

1. You have a Silva Root accessible via a rewrite rule at
   ``http://www.mysite.com``. The Silva Root contains two publications
   ``outside`` and ``inside`` (those two also contains others contents).

2. You set a rewrite rule so that you can access ``inside`` via the URL
   ``http://www.mysite.com/alias``.

Now in your Silva site, in ``inside`` you have a link to ``outside``. Zope
cannot compute the URL ``http://www.mysite.com/outside``, because for Zope the
site begins at ``inside`` represented by ``alias``
(http://www.mysite.com/alias) and that ``outside`` is not inside
``inside``. Probably, by acquisition Zope might be able to create the
buggy URL: ``http://www.mysite.com/alias/outside``.

It is buggy because:

- People having permissions to edit the ``inside`` publication can add
  themselves a content called ``outside`` that visitors will get instead
  the intended publication (it is phishing),

- If you have a document with the same identifier in ``inside``, a link
  to content located inside of ``outside`` might result in 404 error
  instead of the real content,

- URLs appearing in the browser will look wrong (and thatâ€™s why they
  will have those unwanted behaviors),

- The virtual root is the starting point to cache visual design
  resources (CSS, images). Adding a lot more of them makes caching
  less efficient, as more caches will have to be created. Visitors
  will have to re-download CSS and images many times, and will make
  the site slower to browser for them.


Solution
~~~~~~~~

To avoid this we suggest adding Silva Links at the root of your site
to redirect the visitor to the correct content. For instance, in this
example you would create a Silva Link called ``alias``, which points
to ``http://www.mysite.com/inside``.
