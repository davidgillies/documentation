Silva Mailing
-------------

SilvaMailing is an extension product for the Silva content management
system, that allows Silva users to send out mails to website visitors
that have signed up to receive them. It is inspired by an existing
(Drupal-based) mailing system used by the customer that requested the
feature, although it is simpler and highly integrated into, and thus
adjusted for, the Silva CMS.
