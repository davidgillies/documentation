Changes in Silva 3.0 API
========================

Content
-------

- :term:`ZCML` based registration have been removed (because it was
  unused).

- XSTL renderers have been removed (they were only available for
  ``Producs.SilvaDocument`` that is deprecated and not available to
  create new content in 3.0).

- *SilvaViews* have been removed. All :term:`SMI` interfaces must be
  built using forms, in order to work in the new Javascript based
  interface.

- ``CatalogedVersion`` and ``CatalogVersionedContent`` have been
  removed. Please use instead
  :py:class:`~Products.Silva.Version.Version` and
  :py:class:`~Products.Silva.VersionedContent.VersionedContent`. They
  are catalogued by default.

- The method ``view`` and ``preview`` from
  :py:interface:`~silva.core.interfaces.content.ISilvaObject` have
  been removed. To render a content, please invoke the
  ``@@content.html`` view on the content. The preview will be
  automatically selected if you are in preview mode.


Code sources
------------


- ``REQUEST.model`` is no longer available. Code sources must rely on
  the parameters ``model`` and ``version`` that are given to them
  along the regular options.
